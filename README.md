# htdocs

Mirror of my htdocs folder. This includes most of my projects, mostly for school. Feel free to check them out. :)

I've added a star emoji ⭐ to my favorite links.

Everything here (excluding some images/assets & public modules) was created/written by me or my instructor.

Some stuff, including links, may be broken depending on how old the project is. Projects are in order of which they were made.

CPP projects or any other types of files and/or programs that need built may not work on all systems. You'll probably need to modify the makefile for them to build correctly. I might do that myself if I need to do so personally.
